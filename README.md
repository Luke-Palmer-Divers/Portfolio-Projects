### 2. Name Game_Gender Prediction using Sound ⚥
<ins>Business Objective:</ins> Find out the gender of authors in the New York Times Best Selling Books and see if there is any change over time.

🔑 Key Learnings
 - Compared string sounds using Fuzzy package in Python
 - Looped through data from the Social Security Administration’s baby names to obtain male and female genders
 - Created a function to locate names of authors, index, and append to a "list"
 - Looped through that "list" and determined counts of gender
 - Visualized the results by year and separated foreign-born national names (and visualized) as the data for comparison would be for US citizens only.
